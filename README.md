# About
I used the Open Weather Map API to create a react app that displays the daily weather forecast as well as an individual day.
What I would like to add in the future:
* Cleaner design
* Cards that flip
* An animated weather map

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
